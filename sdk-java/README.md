# iwf-sdk (Java)

Java SDK for [iWF workflow engine](https://github.com/superdurable/iwf)

See [samples](../samples-java) for how to use this SDK to build your workflow.

Maven coordinates: `io.superdurable:iwf-sdk` (namespace for domain [superdurable.io](https://superdurable.io)).

## Requirements

- Java 1.8+

## How to use

After publish, artifacts appear on
[Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/superdurable/iwf-sdk/)
(and on [MVN Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.superdurable/iwf-sdk) with some delay).
Javadoc: [javadoc.io](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.superdurable/iwf-sdk/latest/index.html).

### Gradle

```gradle
implementation 'io.superdurable:iwf-sdk:0.0.2'
```

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.superdurable</groupId>
    <artifactId>iwf-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```


## Concepts

To implement a workflow, the two most core interfaces are

* [Workflow interface](src/main/java/io/iworkflow/core/ObjectWorkflow.java)
  defines the workflow definition

* [WorkflowState interface](src/main/java/io/iworkflow/core/WorkflowState.java)
  defines the workflow states for workflow definitions

A workflow can contain any number of WorkflowStates.

## How to build & run

### Using IntelliJ

1. OpenAPI specs live in monorepo [`protos/`](../protos/) (no submodule checkout needed).
2. In "Build, Execution, Deployment" -> "Gradle", choose "wrapper task in Gradle build script" for "Use gradle from".
3. Open Gradle tab, click "build" under "build" to build the project

## Development Guide

### Update IDL

Edit OpenAPI specs in monorepo [`protos/`](../protos/), then regenerate via the Gradle OpenAPI tasks.

### Local testing

If you'd like to test your changes to the SDK with the workflows in the [samples](https://github.com/superdurable/iwf-java-samples) repo, 
use the local publishing command:

1. Run:
  ```
  ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -x signMavenJavaPublication
  ```

2. In the [samples](https://github.com/superdurable/iwf-java-samples) repo, make sure your `build.gradle` depends on the same version you just published. To find which version you published, open the SDK's `build.gradle` file and look for the `version = "x.y.z"` line near the bottom of the file. Then run:
  ```
   ./gradlew --refresh-dependencies build
  ```

3. Once you're done, to remove the locally published version, run:
  ```
  ./gradlew unpublishFromMavenLocal
  ```

### Repo structure
* `.github/workflows/`: the GithubActions workflows
* IDL OpenAPI specs live in monorepo `protos/` (was formerly the `iwf-idl` submodule)
* `script/`: some scripts for GithubActions and testing
* `src/`: Java source code
  * `main/java/io/iworkflow/core/`: SDK code
    * `command/`: the command implementation
    * `communication/`: the communication implementation
    * `mapper/`: the mapper with IDL
    * `persistence/`: the persistence implementation
    * `validator/`: some validators
    * `Client.java`: the client implemntation
    * `...java` ...
  * `test/java/io/iworkflow/`: Java test code (currently only integ test)
    * `spring/`: the integ test setup of using Spring as REST controller
    * `integ/`: the integration tests
      * `XyzTest.java`: a file for test cases
      * `xyz/`: the iWF workflow implementation for the integration test cases
