iWF let you deeply customize the workflow behaviors with the below options.

#### IdReusePolicy for WorkflowId

At any given time, there can be only one WorkflowExecution running for a specific workflowId.
A new WorkflowExecution can be initiated using the same workflowId by setting the appropriate `IdReusePolicy` in
WorkflowOptions.

* `ALLOW_IF_NO_RUNNING` 
    * Allow starting workflow if there is no execution running with the workflowId
    * This is the **default policy** if not specified in WorkflowOptions
* `ALLOW_IF_PREVIOUS_EXITS_ABNORMALLY`
    * Allow starting workflow if a previous Workflow Execution with the same Workflow Id does not have a Completed
      status.
      Use this policy when there is a need to re-execute a Failed, Timed Out, Terminated or Cancelled workflow
      execution.
* `DISALLOW_REUSE` 
    * Not allow to start a new workflow execution with the same workflowId.
* `ALLOW_TERMINATE_IF_RUNNING`
    * Always allow starting workflow no matter what -- iWF server will terminate the current running one if it exists.

Note that the behavior is limited by Cadence/Temporal workflow retention, which is configured at domain/namespace level.
If a workflow is deleted after retention expired, the workflowId can be started regardless of any Policy

#### CRON Schedule

iWF allows you to start a workflow with a fixed cron schedule like below

```text
// CronSchedule - Optional cron schedule for workflow. If a cron schedule is specified, the workflow will run
// as a cron based on the schedule. The scheduling will be based on UTC time. The schedule for the next run only happens
// after the current run is completed/failed/timeout. If a RetryPolicy is also supplied, and the workflow failed
// or timed out, the workflow will be retried based on the retry policy. While the workflow is retrying, it won't
// schedule its next run. If the next schedule is due while the workflow is running (or retrying), then it will skip
that
// schedule. Cron workflow will not stop until it is terminated or cancelled (by returning cadence.CanceledError).
// The cron spec is as follows:
// ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
// │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
// │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
// │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
// │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
// │ │ │ │ │
// │ │ │ │ │
// * * * * *
```

NOTE:

* iWF also
  supports [more advanced cron expressions](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format)
* The [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/) site is useful for testing your cron expressions.
* To cancel a cron schedule, use terminate of cancel type to stop the workflow execution.
* By default, there is no cron schedule.

#### RetryPolicy for workflow

Workflow execution can have a backoff retry policy which will retry on failed or timeout.

By default, there is no retry policy.

#### Initial Search Attributes

Client can specify some initial search attributes when starting the workflow.

By default, there is no initial search attributes.
