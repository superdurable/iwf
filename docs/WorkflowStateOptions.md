users can customize the WorkflowState

#### WorkflowState WaitUntil/Execute API timeout and retry policy

By default, the API timeout is 30s with infinite backoff retry. 
Users can customize the API timeout and retry policy:

- InitialIntervalSeconds: 1
- MaxInternalSeconds:100
- MaximumAttempts: 0
- MaximumAttemptsDurationSeconds: 0
- BackoffCoefficient: 2

Where zero means infinite attempts.

Both MaximumAttempts and MaximumAttemptsDurationSeconds are used for controlling the maximum attempts for the retry
policy.
MaximumAttempts is directly by number of attempts, where MaximumAttemptsDurationSeconds is by the total time duration of
all attempts including retries. It will be capped to the minimum if both are provided.

#### State/RPC API Context
There is a context object when invoking RPC or State APIs. It contains information like workflowId, startTime, etc.

For example, WorkflowState can utilize `attempts` or `firstAttemptTime` from the context to make some advanced logic.
