# iWF — Codex Instructions

Durable workflow framework: Go server (`server/`), OpenAPI IDL (`protos/`), and
SDKs/samples for Go, Java, and Python. See [README.md](README.md) for the module
map.

## Plan Mode

Every plan must include all three sections below. Use `N/A: <one-line reason>`
only when a section genuinely doesn't apply.

- `## Tests` — list specific scenarios (integration vs E2E, why each)
- `## Documentation` — which module READMEs / `CONTRIBUTING.md` to create or update
- `## UI/UX` — usually `N/A: no in-repo web UI`

### Tests

- Default to **integration tests** (`server/integ/`) and SDK integ suites.
- Do NOT add unit tests unless explicitly asked or the edge case is unreachable
  through integration/E2E paths.
- List specific test scenarios — not just "add tests".

### Documentation

- Product docs live in [`docs/`](docs/) (start at [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)).
- Contributor / module docs: update module READMEs or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### UI/UX

- No in-repo web UI. Do not invent Temporal Web work unless the change adds a UI.

## Code Quality Rules

### License Headers

Every new or edited `.go` / `.java` / `.py` file (and hand-written OpenAPI YAML
under `protos/`) must start with the license header for its directory from
[`script/licenseheaders/`](script/licenseheaders/) — selected by longest path
prefix in `mapping.yaml`.

Skip generated trees: `**/gen/**`, `*.pb.go`, `*_pb.go`, `*.gen.*`.

When creating or modifying such a file, check the top; if the header is missing,
add it. From the repo root:

- `make copyright` — add missing headers
- `make copyright-check` — verify (fails if any are missing)
- `make copyright-replace` — replace existing headers with the current
  Super Durable per-directory template (destructive)

### No Backward Compatibility

The project has **not launched**. Remove dead config fields immediately. Break
APIs freely. Ask before adding any compat shim. Do not leave docs/comments that
explain former behavior.

### No Setter Injection

Constructor injection only. Never add `SetXyz`, `Inject*`, `Wire*`, or exported
mutable fields for wiring components after `New*()` returns. Fix bootstrap
ordering instead.

### Inject Config Sections by Pointer, Not Individual Fields

When a component needs tunables from a config section, pass a pointer to that
whole section into its constructor and read fields off it — do NOT thread
individual fields as separate constructor params.

- Store an unexported `cfg *config.XyzConfig`; read `h.cfg.SomeKnob` where used.
  Panic in the constructor if nil.
- Pass the **section**, not the whole `config.Config`, and by **pointer**, not
  value.

### No Stateful Closures — Use Methods on Structs

A closure that captures 3+ outer variables, mutates outer state, is called from
more than one site, or outlives a single statement → lift it into a method on a
struct with explicit fields.

Fine: one-shot callbacks (`sort.Slice`, `errgroup.Go`, `defer`), tiny pure
transforms, IIFEs for scoping.

### No Obvious Comments

Write the fewest comments needed. Never restate what the code or a well-named
identifier already says. Write a comment only for a non-obvious *why*. When in
doubt, improve the name instead.

### Short Comments — Under 20 Words

Every comment block (a contiguous group of `//` lines) must be fewer than 20
words. If you believe a longer one is necessary, ask the user first.

The comment-simplification and 20-word rules do not apply to `server/config/`.
Configuration comments should favor complete operational semantics.

### Preserve Comments During Refactoring

Never delete existing comments during a refactor. Move them with the code they
describe. Rewrite stale comments to reflect the new reality — do not drop them.

### Top-Down File Ordering (Go files)

In the same file, a callee always appears **below** its caller. High-level
orchestration at the top, leaf helpers at the bottom. Preferred order for a
struct-based file:

1. Type declaration
2. Constructor (`new<Type>`)
3. Constructor's own helpers
4. Main entry method (`Run`, `Serve`, `Handle`, `Process`)
5. Per-event/step handlers (in dispatch order)
6. Sub-handlers
7. Mutators / state-changing helpers
8. Encoders / converters / pure transforms
9. Tiny accessors at the very bottom

Exceptions: generated code (leave as-is); tightly grouped methods on different
subsystems in one file (keep the cluster intact).

### `ptr.Any(...)` for Pointer Literals (Go)

Use `ptr.Any(value)` instead of a throwaway local variable taken by address.
Import: `github.com/superdurable/iwf/service/common/ptr` (server) or
`github.com/superdurable/iwf/sdk-go/iwf/ptr` (SDK). Use explicit types for
numerics: `ptr.Any(int64(0))`, `ptr.Any(int32(1))`.

Do not use `ptr.Any` when the pointer must alias an existing named variable that
is also read or mutated elsewhere.

### No Defensive Cloning (Go)

Do not call `proto.Clone` or copy messages merely to guard against caller
mutation. Passing a message transfers ownership unless the API says otherwise.
Workflow inputs, signals, and activity payloads are freshly deserialized and
single-threaded. Prefer immutable use. Copy only when an algorithm requires a
distinct value that it will mutate.

### Update Ignore Files When Producing Binaries

Before running `go build -o <path>` or adding a new `main` package, add the
output path to both `.gitignore` **and** `.dockerignore`. Use exact paths, not
overly broad globs. Delete stray uncommitted binaries.

### Run Tests After Every Change

After code changes, run tests via the Makefile — not bare `go test` for full
suites:

- `make -C server unitTests`
- `make -C server integTests` / `temporalIntegTests` / `cadenceIntegTests`

Always tee output: `make -C server unitTests 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test-<scope>.log`

Fix all failures before moving on. If stuck after multiple attempts, pause and
ask the user with: (1) the failure, (2) what you tried, (3) where you're blocked.

## Go-Specific Rules

### Config Field Comments

Every config struct field must have a Go doc comment:

1. Always state the default value.
2. Explain what it means/controls if non-obvious.
3. State immutability, relationships, valid ranges if constrained.
4. Add a concrete example if tricky.

For address fields, explain protocol served, who connects, and bind-vs-advertise
relationship.

### Go Package Aliases

Use the package's declared name. Only alias when:

- Two packages share the same name in one file.
- The default name is misleading or ambiguous.
- An established repo convention applies (e.g. `iwfidl` for generated OpenAPI).

Do not invent aliases like `servermetrics` or `mongostore`.

### No Unnecessary Nil Checks

Required dependencies must panic or `log.Fatal` if nil — fail fast at startup.
Do not add `if x == nil { return nil }` guards that silently swallow bugs. Only
add nil checks when nil is a valid, expected value.

### Server Error Handling (`server/`)

API failures that reach Gin handlers should use `errors.ErrorAndStatus` from
`github.com/superdurable/iwf/service/common/errors` with an
`iwfidl.ErrorSubStatus` and HTTP status code.

- Prefer `NewErrorAndStatus` / `NewErrorAndStatusWithWorkerError`.
- Bad client/SDK input → 4xx + appropriate `ErrorSubStatus`.
- Infrastructure / unexpected failures → 5xx.

### Never Silently Ignore Errors

Every returned error must be handled — returned, logged, or explicitly acted on.
Never `_ = f()`, `x, _ := f()`, or `if err == nil { use(x) }` with no `else`.
If you genuinely must ignore one, leave a code comment explaining why **and**
call it out in review.

Trusted vs untrusted decides fail-fast vs graceful:

- **Trusted** (our own store rows, server-minted ids, invariants we control): a
  violated invariant is a bug — fail fast. Use a `Must*` helper rather than
  silently ignoring. Better still, thread the typed value end-to-end.
- **Untrusted** (HTTP request fields, SDK/worker payloads, anything a client can
  set): must handle gracefully — validate and return an input-style
  `ErrorAndStatus`; **never** `Must*`/panic.

### Naming — No 1-2 Letter Variable Names

Variables (struct fields, parameters, locals) must use descriptive names. Method
receivers are exempt (Go convention: `func (w *Worker) ...`).

Allowed short non-receiver names: `i j k n err ctx ok t mu wg id r w ch`

## Test Isolation Rules

### No `time.Sleep` for Async Convergence

Use `require.Eventually` or a polling loop. `time.Sleep` is only acceptable
inside the system under test itself.

### Unique IDs Per Test

Generate unique workflow IDs (and namespaces when applicable) per test when
sharing a Temporal/Cadence stack. Never rely on leftover state from another test.
